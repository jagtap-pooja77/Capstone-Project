# Colmar Academy

## 🎓 About This Project
This repo contains the landing page for **Colmar Academy**, a fictional school built from wireframes as part of Codecademy's "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" path. The goal is to implement the structure defined in the wireframes and make design decisions for color, typography, and responsiveness.
